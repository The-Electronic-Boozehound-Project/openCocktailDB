## Xfer Format: Enhanced Markdown for DB Input and Output
The goal is to set up an extended markdown format that is human usable and equivalent to the DB schema in the sense that the writing and DB format are completely interchangable. So new specs can be loaded as easily as writing some Markdown, imported with completely fidelity (or effectively the same) and also use the extended Markdown as a formatter for DB output.
